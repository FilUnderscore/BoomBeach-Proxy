# BoomBeach-Proxy
A proxy written in C++ for Boom Beach v32.78. This simple proxy outputs basic packet information between the Boom Beach Server and Boom Beach Client.

## Usage
* Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/FilUnderscore/BoomBeach-Proxy/releases) page.
* Modify your `hosts` file on your device with Boom Beach installed to point `game.boombeachgame.com` to your proxy host (computer running the proxy).
* Run the proxy and connect to the proxy by opening the game.
